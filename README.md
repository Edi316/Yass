# Yass Karaoke Editor
Yass is a graphical editor for finetuning Ultrastar karaoke songs. You can drag & drop notes, spread syllables, and find errors. Further you can filter your song library, mass-tag or batch-correct them, or search for lyrics.

I develop it since 2009, just for leisure. Don't expect anything.

Contact me if you want to contribute to this project.

Have fun! :musical_note:
